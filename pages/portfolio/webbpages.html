              <p> One of my side projects where I'm testing to build a webpage for a fictive company. I've done this page mobile first to callenge myself and it's made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>
              <p> I started this project before I entered this course and will keep on develop the page as I go on. I's my very own project and no assignment, and that is very fun to create something new. Design isn't my strong side, but I'm trying to study and learn some basics from here and there. </p>

              <p> The project was a part of my education, but I've modified it and will keep on develop it in time. </p>
              <p>This is my first attemt in creating something with react and understanding using state, components and routing, and I'm proud of the result so far.</p>

              <p> This app was made as a group project in IT:Tech for women. We were three group members and took equaly part of developing this game and all the functionallity. </p>
              <p> The game is made using React and included practising fetching via API, using state, using JSON-server and much more!  </p>
              <p>This project was a big challenge but I'm so glad that we made everything work in such a short period of time. </p>

              <p> Assignment in the course IT:Tech for women. The assignment was to recreate a responsive design of the fictive company Bhromaon handed to us in Figma. 
                  The assignment did not include functionallity - links/buttons/form do not work. 
              </p>
              <p> In this project we had a timeframe, we had to complete the project in 12 hours. I managed to finnish in time, other than a few details that I've fixed later 
              </p>
              <p> It was a good lesson to have to plan your work to be able to make it. I started with the basic structure in doing all the sections and major styling, and then took every section to fix the details.

              <p> My first attempt of making my own program using JavaScript.  
              </p>
              <p> I used the knowledge from an assignment in my education and made a program for practicing basic math problems. Since this is my first try there are probably better ways to code this, but the basics work and I'm very proud of it. 
              </p>
              <p> There are still some things that doesn't work as it should and I keep on working at this. It's a great challenge to be able to create something with JavaScript like this and I'm learning a lot in how to use functions, statements and variables.
